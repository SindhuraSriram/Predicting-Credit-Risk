This project aims to develop a credit risk classification model using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes various attributes like the age, annual income, home ownership, employment length, loan purpose, loan grade, loan amount, interest rate, loan percentage of income, past defaults, and credit history of loan applicants. To enhance the model's performance, data will be scaled and PCA will be used for dimensionality reduction. Logistic Regression will be applied to classify the credit risk, distinguishing between default and non-default cases, thereby aiding banks in making informed lending decisions.
